# Malicius Url Detection App

The objective of this project is to create a full app that includes the modelling in jupyter coding that can be altered later and the model use as API and web App

So in terms of building what we need is to:
- Setup the Enviroment
- Gather the training data from kaggle
- Preprocess the data (Convert to model reading)
- Model Building
- Model Saving
- Flask API returning the probabilities
- Flask WebApp returing the info and probabilities


Ml:
- notebooks/Modelling contains how the model was built
- models/ where the pickle models stay

App Setup:
- go to app/
- terminal: "flask run"
